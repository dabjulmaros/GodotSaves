water shader:
		https://godotshaders.com/shader/wind-waker-water-no-textures-needed/

issues:
	monster spawnning too low, and making it so the player always bounces off
	(see player.gd line 64)
	FIXED: the mob scene was modified so that the node center was at the bottom of the character
		and hit boxes
		
todo: 
	add combo - Done
	make the enviroment look good?
